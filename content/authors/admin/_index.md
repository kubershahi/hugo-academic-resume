I currently work as a Data Scientist at [Vayana Network](https://vayana.com), where I analyze and interpret company's data to identify key patterns, trends and possible avenues for business growth strategies. 

I am broadly interested in machine learning and its intersection with vision, language, healthcare, and other areas, with a focus on building inclusive and accessible language and vision models that can be applied across diverse domains and languages.
